### Hi, I'm Peter! (ﾉ ◕ ヮ ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ ✧

I'm a student interested in math, CS, and bioinformatics—especially where they intersect. I love solving hard problems, whether through AI-driven research, competitive programming, or mathematical modeling. Lately, I've been working on computational biology research to improve drug discovery and gene expression analysis.

Right now, I'm working on BioRSP, a tool for gene expression heterogeneity analysis. Additionally, I am working with programmes to bring AI and bioinformatics education to underserved communities in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. I believe that access to STEM education is crucial for empowering the next generation of innovators, and I'm committed to making a difference in this area. 🔮(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و
