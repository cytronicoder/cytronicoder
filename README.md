- Created a web app for helping users to [visualize Singapore taxi locations](https://singapore-taxified.cytronicoder.repl.co) using real-time taxi availability data from data.gov.sg
- Built a Connect 4 solver during [Fundamentals of Computer Science](https://cty.jhu.edu/programs/summer/courses/fundamentals-of-computer-science-fcps); ~it got beaten by another algorithm so~ then I made [a better one](https://github.com/cytronicoder/connect-four) (takes a while to run for some initial position though)
