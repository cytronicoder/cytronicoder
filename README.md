üëã I'm a student developer currently studying in Singapore.

## üö¢ Projects I've worked on

- Connect 4 solver during [Fundamentals of Computer Science](https://cty.jhu.edu/programs/summer/courses/fundamentals-of-computer-science-fcps); ~it got beaten by another algorithm so~ then I made [a better one](https://github.com/cytronicoder/connect-four) (takes a while to run for some initial position though)
- Butterfly classifier using Jetson Nano during [iD Tech's AI ML course with NVIDIA](https://www.idtech.com/courses/ai-and-machine-learning-academy-with-nvidia); [code](https://github.com/cytronicoder/butterfly-classification)
- [Stock data visualiser](https://github.com/cytronicoder/stock-data-visualiser) that uses the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) to get stock data
- [Website](https://github.com/cytronicoder/singapore-taxified) that visualise Singapore taxi locations using real-time taxi availability data from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/) - **I'm rebooting this project and making it better! Check out the [new branch](https://github.com/cytroncioder/singapore-taxified/tree/new)**
