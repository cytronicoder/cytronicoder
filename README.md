### Hi, I'm Peter!

I’m a student interested in math, CS, and bioinformatics—especially where they intersect. I love solving hard problems, whether through AI-driven research, competitive programming, or mathematical modeling. Lately, I’ve been working on computational biology research to improve drug discovery and gene expression analysis. (ﾉ ◕ ヮ ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ ✧

I started with math competitions, qualifying for **USAMO** in 2023 with a 243.5 and ranking **1st in Southeast Asia for AIME**. I also got a perfect 150/150 in AMC 10, scored 141/150 on AMC 12, and placed in the top 1% for both. In computing, I advanced to **USACO Platinum**, earning perfect scores in Gold and Silver. I’ve also won over 10 gold medals in international math contests, ranking top 5 globally in SASMO, AMO, and Math Kangaroo.

My focus shifted to research when I joined **AI.MED Lab at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (2023 - Present)**, where I built BioRSP, a tool for spatial gene expression analysis that identifies biomarkers in high-dimensional biological data. This led to a first-author paper on bioRxiv and conference presentations at ICIBM 2024 (Rice University), IEEE BHI 2024 (Texas Medical Center), and GIW ISCB Asia 2023, where I was the youngest speaker.

Last summer, I worked at **Stanford AI4ALL (2023)** on an autonomous aircraft taxiing system, training neural networks to improve runway alignment. This year, I joined **Garcia Research Scholar Program at Stony Brook University (2024)**, developing ProLiDE, an AI-driven drug evaluation framework for ranking drug candidates by efficacy and specificity.

Outside research, I founded the SAIS Hack Club (2021 - Present) to create a space for students to work on CS projects, running workshops and coding sessions for 40+ members. I also helped organize **BuildingbloCS (2023 - Present), Singapore’s largest AI-focused student conference**, bringing together 300+ participants from 50+ schools. As **President of SAIS Math Honor Society**, I organized 10+ global math competitions, helping 500+ students compete and earn 100+ awards. I’ve also worked with Hack Club HQ, supporting students in Singapore to start new clubs and run hackathons.

Beyond STEM, I co-lead the **IJHS Global Student Leadership Council (GSLC) (2022 - Present)**, managing programs for 1,700+ scholars from 30+ countries. I also serve as an Executive Organizer at **YALA (Young Achievers Leadership Academy) (2021 - Present)**, running leadership programs for 400+ students, expanding outreach to underserved regions in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and developing hands-on STEM workshops.

Right now, I’m refining ProLiDE to integrate multi-source biological data for drug discovery and improving BioRSP to analyze gene expression heterogeneity. I’m also leading mentorship programs in CS and AI, helping more students gain access to computational learning. 🔮(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و
