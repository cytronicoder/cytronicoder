### Hi again! (✧ω✧)

Here's a more retrospective look at my journey so far:

I was born in Shanghai, China, and moved to Singapore at age 10, where I am currently a senior at **Stamford American International School (SAIS)**. I started with math competitions when I realized I could solve problems faster than my classmates. Not long after, I discovered competitive programming and AI during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eventually, I qualified for **USAMO** in 2023 with a 243.5 and ranked **1st in Southeast Asia for AIME**. I also got a perfect 150/150 in AMC 10, scored 141/150 on AMC 12, and placed in the top 1% for both. In computing, I advanced to **USACO Platinum**, earning perfect scores in Gold and Silver. I've also won over 10 gold medals in international math contests, ranking top 5 globally in SASMO, AMO, and Math Kangaroo.

My focus shifted to research when I joined **AI.MED Lab at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (2023 - Present)**, where I built BioRSP, a tool for spatial gene expression analysis that identifies biomarkers in high-dimensional biological data. This led to a first-author paper on bioRxiv and conference presentations at ICIBM 2024 (Rice University), IEEE BHI 2024 (Texas Medical Center), and GIW ISCB Asia 2023, where I was the youngest speaker.

Last summer, I worked at **Stanford AI4ALL (2023)** on an autonomous aircraft taxiing system, training neural networks to improve runway alignment. This year, I joined **Garcia Research Scholar Program at Stony Brook University (2024)**, developing ProLiDE, an AI-driven drug evaluation framework for ranking drug candidates by efficacy and specificity.

Outside research, I founded the SAIS Hack Club (2021 - Present) to create a space for students to work on CS projects, running workshops and coding sessions for 40+ members. I also helped organize **BuildingbloCS (2023 - Present), Singapore's largest AI-focused student conference**, bringing together 300+ participants from 50+ schools. As **President of SAIS Math Honor Society**, I organized 10+ global math competitions, helping 500+ students compete and earn 100+ awards. I've also worked with Hack Club HQ, supporting students in Singapore to start new clubs and run hackathons.

Beyond STEM, I co-lead the **IJHS Global Student Leadership Council (GSLC) (2022 - Present)**, managing programs for 1,700+ scholars from 30+ countries. I also serve as an Executive Organizer at **YALA (Young Achievers Leadership Academy) (2021 - Present)**, running leadership programs for 400+ students, expanding outreach to underserved regions in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and developing hands-on STEM workshops.
